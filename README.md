# Oscar's 2025 Data Prediction

This is a collection of data for the 2025 Oscar nominees and their award history.

We use the downloaded html of the [Oscars Official Website](https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2025) to get information about the nominees.
The nominees are then used to find movie information from [MUBI](https://mubi.com/en/us). 
- *Note: Not all slugs match up (due to duplicate movie titles, articles, etc.) so replacement names will have to either be manually defined or cleverly searched for and populated.*

Feel free to download the data and play around with it yourself.

Below is a chat conversation with ChatGPT analyzing the results.

- **Category**: The Oscar category.

- **Award**: The specific award won or nominated for.
- **Year**: The year of the award.

### Next Steps:
I'll analyze the awards data to see which films have won the most relevant awards leading up to the Oscars, as previous wins (e.g., Golden Globes, BAFTAs, Critics&#8217; Choice) often indicate strong chances of winning an Oscar.</div></pre>

      <pre

### Explanation:
I selected the most likely winners based on the total number of prior awards their film has won. Films like *Anora* (36 awards) and *The Brutalist* (33 awards) have strong momentum, suggesting they are leading contenders across multiple categories.

Would you like any further refinement, such as factoring in specific prestigious awards (Golden Globes, BAFTAs, etc.)?</div></pre>
      <pre
        class="message"><div class="author">user</div><div>yes, weigh the awards however you see fit to give the most precise guess</div></pre>
      <pre class="message"><div class="author">ChatGPT</div><div>To refine the predictions, I'll weigh the awards based on prestige. Major awards like the Golden Globes, BAFTAs, Critics&#8217; Choice, and SAG Awards are stronger predictors of Oscar winners. I'll assign weights to different awards and recalculate the most likely winners.  

### **Weighting System for Awards:**
- **5 points** &#45; Academy Award (if available, historical wins for films)  
- **4 points** &#45; BAFTA, Golden Globe, SAG, Critics&#8217; Choice, PGA, DGA, WGA  
- **3 points** &#45; Cannes (Palme d&#8217;Or, Grand Prix), Venice (Golden Lion), TIFF (People&#8217;s Choice), Berlin (Golden Bear)  
- **2 points** &#45; National Board of Review, Spirit Awards, European Film Awards, major critics associations (NYFCC, LAFCA)  
- **1 point** &#45; Other festival or minor critic awards  

I'll now compute the weighted award scores and update the predictions.</div></pre>
      <pre
        class="message"><div class="author">ChatGPT</div><div>### **Refined Oscar Predictions (Based on Weighted Awards Data)**  

These winners have been chosen based on the weighted prestige of prior awards, prioritizing Golden Globes, BAFTAs, Critics' Choice, and other major predictors.

2. **Actor in a Supporting Role** &#45; **Guy Pearce** (*The Brutalist*) &#45; 134 weighted points  
3. **Actress in a Leading Role** &#45; **Mikey Madison** (*Anora*) &#45; 129 weighted points

### **Key Takeaways:**

- **Emilia P&eacute;rez (119 points)** is a strong contender in International Feature, Makeup, Sound, and Adapted Screenplay.  
- **Anora (129 points)** remains a major player, particularly in Lead Actress.  
- **Wicked (65 points)** has the edge in **Visual Effects**, while **Flow (74 points)** is the likely **Best Animated Feature** winner.  

Would you like me to fine-tune the methodology further, perhaps factoring in specific historical trends for each category?</div></pre>
      <pre class="message"><div class="author">user</div><div>Yes please</div></pre>
      <pre class="message"><div class="author">ChatGPT</div><div>To refine the predictions even further, I'll incorporate **historical category trends** based on past Oscar winners. Certain categories have consistent predictors:

### **Additional Refinements:**
1. **Best Picture**: Films that win PGA, DGA, or BAFTA Best Film often take the Oscar.
2. **Acting Categories**: SAG winners have been strong predictors.
3. **Director**: The DGA winner has matched the Oscar winner in 17 of the last 20 years.
4. **Editing**: BAFTA and ACE Eddie Awards winners tend to predict Oscar winners.
5. **Cinematography**: The ASC (American Society of Cinematographers) winner is a strong predictor.
6. **Animated Feature**: Annie Awards &amp; BAFTA Best Animated Feature are key predictors.
7. **International Feature**: Films that won **Cannes' Palme d&#8217;Or** or Venice&#8217;s **Golden Lion** tend to do well.
8. **Writing Categories**: WGA (Writers Guild) winners have been strong indicators.

### **Next Steps:**  
- I&#8217;ll check if each nominee has won major predictors like SAG, DGA, PGA, WGA, BAFTA, or ACE Eddie.
- I'll adjust the weighted scores accordingly.

        class="message"><div class="author">ChatGPT</div><div>It looks like there was an issue with column naming. I'll check the dataframe structure and ensure the correct column name is used before applying the historical award adjustments. Let me fix this now.</div></pre>
